        <h3>Welcome to our Midterm Project! <br>Today we're here to settle a timeless debate: Anime versus Manga. </h3>

    <h2> Why Anime is better </h2>

    <p>Anime, with its captivating visuals and immersive storytelling, offers a dynamic and engaging experience 
    that transcends traditional boundaries. Unlike manga, which relies solely on static illustrations and text, 
    anime brings narratives to life through fluid animation, vibrant colors, and expressive character designs. 
    The medium's audiovisual elements, including voice acting, soundtracks, and sound effects, further enhance 
    the emotional impact of the story, drawing viewers deeper into the fictional worlds portrayed.</p>
    <div> Moreover, anime has the ability to adapt and expand upon manga source material, offering unique 
    perspectives and interpretations that can enrich the original story. Through skilled direction and 
    animation, anime studios can breathe new life into beloved characters and plotlines, exploring themes 
    and emotions in ways that resonate with audiences on a profound level. Additionally, the collaborative 
    nature of anime production allows for creative input from talented artists, writers, and directors, 
    resulting in a diverse range of genres and styles that cater to a wide audience.

    <ul>
    <p>Compared to anime, manga series usually feature more in-depth character development and storytelling. Manga authors have more time to create story ideas and thoroughly examine subjects because their chapters are published more slowly. For some readers, this can result in a deeper and more engaging reading experience. Additionally, Anime adaptations sometimes deviate from the original manga due to constraints like episode count, production deadlines, or studio decisions. This can lead to filler episodes or changes in the storyline that may not resonate with fans of the manga.</p>
